The last working version is V2.0 which you can get here : https://bottled-up-studio.itch.io/bottled-tilemap

# Credits

This plugin includes features and code from other plugins. My goal is to have all possible tilemap features in only 1 plugin.
Including : 
- Used the interface of [Tile Palette](https://github.com/nklbdev/godot-tile-palette) by Nklbdev as the base for my own
- Merged it with the interface of [TileCell Manager](https://github.com/TheCowOhBoy/TileCellManager-for-Godot) by TheCowOhBoy
- Added the features of [Tile Spawner](https://github.com/qtip/tile-spawner) by QTip
- Took some code from [TileMapBrush](https://github.com/VitMush/godot-addon-TileMapBrush) by VitMush
- Used a [math function](https://godotengine.org/qa/64496/how-to-get-a-random-tile-in-a-radious) by Zylann to get coordinates in a certain radius
